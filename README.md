## üöÄ Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
3. Clone this repository or download the source code
4. Run the game:
```bash
python "tetris-game.py"
```

## üéÆ How to Play

The goal is to clear as many lines as possible by arranging falling tetromino pieces. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the playing field.

## üéπ Game Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ‚Üê | Move piece left |
| ‚Üí | Move piece right |
| ‚Üì | Soft drop (move down faster) |
| ‚Üë | Rotate piece |
| Space | Hard drop (instantly drop piece) |
| C | Hold piece |
| P | Pause/Resume game |
| R | Restart game |

        V --> C
    end
```

## üíØ Scoring System

The scoring system is based on the number of lines cleared simultaneously:

| Lines Cleared | Base Points | Level Multiplier |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 line | 100 | √ó Level |
| 2 lines | 300 | √ó Level |
| 3 lines | 500 | √ó Level |
| 4 lines | 800 | √ó Level |

- Level increases every 10 lines cleared
- Fall speed increases with level
- Maximum level: 10 (fall speed capped)

2. **PieceGenerator Class**
   - Implements the "bag" system for piece generation
   - Prevents unfair sequences (max 2 consecutive same pieces)

3. **TetrisGame Class**
   - Main game logic and state management
   - Handles game loop, scoring, and rendering
   - Manages piece placement and line clearing

### Key Constants
- Screen Size: 1024√ó900 pixels
- Grid Size: 10√ó20 blocks
- Block Size: 30 pixels
- Initial Fall Speed: 0.5 seconds per step
- Minimum Fall Speed: 0.05 seconds per step

### Color Scheme
